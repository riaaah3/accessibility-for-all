# accessibility-for-all

## Description

This website was created with accessibility in mind. 
Making websites accessible for all users is not only good practice for businesses,
but it is good practice in general.
It shows that developers are mindful of what they are making and 
that they are trying to make sure what they are making is available for most, if not all users.
This project is titled "accessibility for all" because it is made to be accessible for all.
By adding alt attriutes, organizing and adding descriptions to the CSS file,
not only is this website more accessible to a wide range of users, but it is also better optimized
for search engines such as Google.
